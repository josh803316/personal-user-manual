# Personal User Manual

Welcome to the personal user manual of Josh Nisenson - SVP of Engineering at Videate.

## About Me
### Who is Josh Nisenson (pronounced nis-in-sun)
I am a UCSB grad with a math and cs background who started my career in Quality Assurance 25+ years ago. I have worked in the worlds of telecommunications, automated testing, advertising technology, educational technology, and have now ventured into Video automation. I go by Josh :)

I am a born and raised in Sonoma County (also known as wine country) and played lots of sports, especially baseball as a kid. I enjoy anything competitive and can say with confidence that I hate losing more than I like winning. I believe my superpower is being able to find problems with systems, processes, behaviors and to improve them. 

## How to Contact Me
Considering the fact that we are all remote, here are some quick tips on how to get in touch with me for work:

### Tips
1. You can always reach me on Slack for anything quick, I have an open door policy
2. If you want to connect, an impromptu Slack huddle or Zoom meeting works well
3. I always keep my email inbox clean. If you are more of an email person, do not fear I will definitely see it.
4. For anything that needs a larger conversation, grab some time on my calendar. I do my best to keep it up to date
5. I am located in Brazil, at the moment, but my normal block hours are generally 8am - 5pm PST (or 12-9 BR time during Daylight savings and 1-10 when the time changes for fall/winter)

If you do not get a reaction or response within an hour or so, feel free to follow up via text.

## My Working Style/Expectations

### Josh Style
- I see my team as a "team" - sports analogies will be used - and I expect that team to work together in order to win
- I like surrounding myself with problem solvers. I think like an engineer but have evolved into a people manager / leader over time so I love to tackle problems. 
- When my coworkers look to me for help/support I prefer they lead with the problem not the potential solutions. Working out solutions is what I do best!
- I love to talk through ideas out loud
- Huge on continously developing company culture

### Weaknesses I Am Conscious Of

- I have strong feelings about engineering practices/principles so I occasionally push on making changes
- I have strong feelings about testing practices, devops and CI approaches - but I will try not to be too prescriptive

### My Values (and what I value in others)

- Work together to achieve great things
- Nobody should be too big or important to do the small things needed for success - We should recognize great things!
- The makeup of a great team includes diversity in skills, ideas, and people
- I do not like single points of failure! (I like when more experienced engineers train less experienced engineers on how to do the things that they know)

### Quotes I live by
“Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are.” - John Wooden

“It’s the one thing you can control. You are responsible for how people remember you—or don’t. So don’t take it lightly.” - Kobe Bryant

“He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.” – Muhammad Ali


## My Pet Peeves
### Don't take offense - it's probably not about you
- Deadlines without context - if something absolutely has to be done by a certain date at least give me the courtesy of telling me why
- People who describe me in the "& team" bucket. Saying "manager name and team worked really hard on _____" is not good enough. Unless the team is > 5 people, use names.
- When people say "that is not my job" - I expect everyone to be comfortable wearing multiple hats. Do what needs to be done to get the job done. 
- Unproductive meetings - scheduled meetings are a necessary evil in the workplace, but if you are blocking time, remember your meeting costs the company the salaries of everyone involved in the meeting for however long the meeting runs.

## Things You Should Know About Me
- 49ers, Warriors, Giants > all other sports teams
- I hate awkward silence
- I love sour candy
- I played baseball at the semi-pro level but am willing to compete in basically anything

## Things You May Not Know About Me
- Almost everywhere I've ever worked has been acquired - I've been through 6 acquisitions
- My longest singe company experience was 8 years (Occam networks before it was acquired by Calix)
- I'm the oldest of 4 children (3 boys and 1 girl who is the youngest)
- My wife is Brazilian and we are living in Brazil with our 2 young boys (Victor 11 and Andrew 8) to teach them about the culture and diversity of their mother's background. My in-laws live with us in the US and are permanent residents of the U.S. but they only speak Portuguese so the boys are getting a nice intro to the bi-lingual life :)
- I love Fantasy Football and have been playing for 30 years

## My Claims to Fame
- I have a patent to my name via developing a ruby gem for a company called Mu-Dynamics -- the gem converts a har file (http archcive) to the Mu dynamics domain specific language.
- I tried out for 6 professional baseball teams (at the same time) when I was 25 but they said despite my skills I was too old to be getting back into baseball (since everyone else at the tryout was 18)

## My Swings And Misses
I have had plenty of "great ideas" that never came to fruition. Owning those "swings and misses" I think helps me keep moving forward

- I started a medical/healthcare startup as the CTO with a friend from college many years ago and we won 350K in a competition for new startups and 6 months of office space at Venrock capital. Unfortunately due to circumstances outside of our control it did not last and we ran out of money. It's very hard working with different hospitals and universities - lots of red tape and delays.
